## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learned how to use pseudo-elements and how to use them to create an overlay on top of an image. I also learned how to use the `mix-blend-mode` property to blend the image with the background.

```css
.card-media > img {
  opacity: 0.7;
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```
